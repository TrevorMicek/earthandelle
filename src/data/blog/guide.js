            {title:"What is biotin?", text:"Biotin is a water-soluble, non-metabolized vitamin that helps metabolize fats, amino acids and carbohydrates. Our bodies need biotin to maintain healthy hair, skin and nails as well as helping our cells grow. With a deficiency of biotin, these processes break down which can lead to brittle nails or hair loss. Biotin is found in both animal sources (egg yolks, meat) as well as plant sources (bananas, leafy greens). You may want to consider taking supplements if your diet doesn’t include enough of these foods or if you are on a vegan diet.", numTitle:""},
            {title:"What are collagen gummies?", text:"Collagen is a protein that is naturally produced by our bodies. It is vital for healthy skin, joints, hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and discs. With age or strenuous exercise we may not produce enough collagen on our own. This is where taking collagen supplements become important.", numTitle:""},
            {title:"", text:"Collagen supplements come in many shapes and forms but the most common are tablets or capsules that are taken orally with water. Some people find it hard to swallow so they prefer chewable tablets such as gummies. There are plenty of vegan options out there if you're looking for a more sustainable way to get your daily dose of collagen!", numTitle:""},
            {title:"Vegan Collagen Gummies Active Ingredients", text:"Collagen is an essential protein that forms part of the skin, bone, cartilage, muscles, and tendons. A lack of collagen in your diet can lead to a variety of health problems including brittle nails, hair loss or thinning, wrinkles or lines around your mouth or eyes. These vegan gummies are made with collagen peptides which are easily digested by our bodies for maximum absorption. The gummies also contain vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, biotin, Glycine and Lysine which encourages production of collagen in our bodies.", numTitle:""},
            {subTitle:"Vitamin A", text:"Vitamin A is an essential vitamin for healthy skin, hair, and eyes. Many people take it as a supplement in the form of retinol or beta carotene. It's also used in topical treatments for skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, or eczema.", numTitle:""},
            {subTitle:"Vitamin C", text:"Vitamin C is a water soluble vitamin. It can be found in foods such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, broccoli, strawberries and kiwi fruit. It is also found in supplements such as tablets or capsules. Vitamin C is involved in many body processes, but the most well-known function of Vitamin C is to maintain healthy skin tissue by aiding the production of collagen in the body.", numTitle:""},
            {subTitle:"Vitamin E", text:"Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps keep your skin, hair, and nails healthy. It also helps maintain the health of your immune system. Additionally, vitamin E is essential for maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.", numTitle:""},

            {title:"", text:"-Biotin levels are often depleted in people who eat a lot of processed food because it's usually found in animal products.", numTitle:""},

            {subTitle:"Glycine", text:"Glycine is the amino acid that is necessary for the production of keratin, a protein that forms part of skin, hair, nails and connective tissues in the body.
